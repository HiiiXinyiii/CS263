        "reply": "Congrats! I’m 23, and growing up, my parents didn’t have a lot of money. We did ok but I didn’t have a lot of the “extras” my friends had, not that I ever really got too upset about it as it was normal for us. Then I took it for granted when I got into my teens and they were finally able to take my brother (+2yrs) and I on vacations, buy us new gadgets, spend a little extra here and there on stuff we didn’t *need.* I didn’t really notice things were changing for the better for us and I was just like “oh this is cool.” Looking back now, I’m so grateful and proud of them for working as hard as they did to get us there, and for where they are now. They tell me now that all they really did for my first 15 years or so was struggle to keep afloat. Now, as a struggling 20 something (same age they were when they had my brother), I think they got pretty lucky too. A little luck, help, and elbow grease goes a long way. \nAnyway, this makes me genuinely happy for you. I’m happy you are so thrilled, which you should be. You’re an example for what’s possible for all of us. Remember this feeling forever! Woohoooo!!!"

        "reply": "Good for you!!!  \n\nAs an old fart that has been rich and then poor and then rich and then poor etc...  to stay Not poor, it's essential to save as much as you can till you have a significant nest egg. There's nothing wrong with continuing to coupon clip. Just because you can afford to eat out doesn't mean you have to. 1st class hotels aren't worth the money on vacation, the hotel should only be for sleeping in. Continuing to be frugal is still a good way to ensure a good lifestyle.  Every paycheck pay yourself first, meaning put a specific amount into the bank before you spend any money.  As that grows, roll the bank account into an investment.  Have a specific, budgeted amount of money you allow yourself for discretionary purchases and fun. When you have 2 full years of living expenses banked you can decide to adjust your discretionary spending. Meanwhile educate yourself about how to make your money grow and never forget the lessons you learned when you were poor by helping others who are in need."

It's not just about the figures in your bank account, it's about the peace you've found and the battles you no longer have to fight. I hope you're basking in that newfound tranquility and using those worries of the past as a stepping stone towards a future that's as secure as it is bright.

Your perseverance is commendable and a beacon of hope. Keep going, keep growing, and enjoy every moment of your hard-earned stability. Cheers to a life where the phrase 'financial freedom' takes on a personal and profound meaning for you!"

I’m retired and can get up when I like, go for a bike ride or hike if I feel like it. My husband and I can meet friends for happy hour almost any day of the week. I still have chores but the work is a healthy balance to the recreation and quiet times. Of course life’s not always a picnic. We have our challenges. However, it’s a nice change from the hectic younger years. Life has many seasons and I guess the trick is to find the things you enjoy at the moment and savor them. And also know that the stresses are, more than likely, temporary."

I’m older and experienced enough to accept that doing this planning makes her very happy and just bit into it.  I took the list and carefully chose all of the plates, balloons and such exactly as she requested.   Even for things I thought were silly or stupid.  \n\n\nI have an excellent phone voice but hated my first job always passing me —the only non-admin female— the phones.   But I can kinda understand, as I have a very pleasant, professional cadence.  Then one day, I had to go out to a site.   Since I was the last person In the office, I pushed the phones to another office location.

Do all that \"domestic\" crap. \n\nEven other secretaries and paralegals do some of these things, like tidying up the break room and cleaning up after themselves. The men at the firm, and there are mostly older men, often have that same attitude. They.. don't seem to care about picking up after themselves. Weather it's them washing something and leaving a bunch of water, leaving a knife in the sink when the dishwasher is less than a foot away, spilling coffee all over the place and just leaving. A bunch of little things you notice that the secretaries, or me, just come back around to do because we know they won't. \n\nIt's an interesting observation, and its one part of the job I don't particularly jump up and down about.

        "reply": ">if we don't do it, it won't get done\" attitude\n\nFor me, and most of the women in my office, it's this one. Although, our office is 60% women so statistically, we kind of have to. \n\nBut there are times when I feel like, \"why do I even have to say this?\" For example, a few days ago, we ran out of paper towels. One of the guys asked me \"hey where do we get more?\" (Which is totally fine, he's newer and didn't know.) So I told him to either call or email the admin and tell her we need more. He was like, \"ok cool.\" A few hours later, I was going to the break room and he was like \"hey, come look at this!\" And he wanted to show me that he was able to get a few more packs of paper towels. We have a towel dispenser that you have to manually put in the towels. So when he wanted to show me the towels, I said \"oh did you put them in the dispens-- oh no you didn't...\" Jokingly he went \"ugghhh fine!\" But like, why do I need to tell you that if you get more paper towels, that you should be putting them away? And this isn't just him. Whenever we receive supplies, most of the guys just leave them in the break room instead of actually putting them away. And it's so frustrating. I've just been leaving them there. For a while, it seemed like I was the only one that was organizing the break room and really didn't understand what's so hard about just finding a space for things in the cabinets."

It's just how she was raised.\n\nI think a lot of it does tie into self-worth. We're taught that serving others gives us purpose. That behavior is modeled by other women in our lives. Even if it doesn't make someone happy to be this way, it's a core value that has been ingrained since childhood. It's like the breadwinner mentality conditioned into men."

I organized an event a while ago and a guy signed up to bring food and I was shocked (and delighted!).  Turns out his wife made it.  In my experience, if women don't do these things then these things don't happen.  Not once, in all of my years in this workplace, has a guy ever indicated that they wanted to do something like that but couldn't because the women were claiming all the spots or opportunities or whatever.  You could make a case that these types of things and events don't need to happen but if you want things like treats  for people's birthdays or office potlucks someone has to do it and the men in the office just aren't doing it."

Could there be some deeply internalized misogyny telling me to get out of men's way so they don't walk into me? Sure, but I'm too busy and don't give a shit so I move and keep on my merry way."

Sometimes women help, but there's definitely a skew for men doing that stuff. For valentine's day I arranged the cookies, but that's because had a link with a place that did really cute custom cookies. Usually women lead the charge to sort out food, decorations etc.\n\nI never really thought about it as playing traditional roles, but rather division of labour and everyone gravitating to something they feel comfortable with. Personally I never saw it as unfair; it's not like the men weren't don't anything.\n\nBut maybe others saw it as unfair but are afraid to say anything. I see many in this thread saying that they're a woman and they just didn't have the courage to speak up.\n\nIdk, I like setting up the music and being DJ. Plus I think I'm good at it(i'm not). I always thought women liked doing the decorations and were having fun. Going through the comments though, it sounds like I'm wrong and women actually feel pressured into doing these things"

We eventually had a pretty useful buddy system for this in our office, where if you saw your buddy taking on a domestic role you helped out (provided you weren’t in the middle of something important) or at least offered to do so. Or if you were taking on a task/set of tasks that could be handled better with another person, then they were the person you got. It wasn’t super set in stone and official, but it ended up being the most effective method.\n\nIt actually ended up being applied because it was technically my job to do most of these things, but they kept finding much more important work that I was unexpectedly good at doing and couldn’t walk away from once given. Eventually they changed my job title to remove those domestic responsibilities from me, because my (usually male) coworkers kept trying to pull me away from the work I was doing to clean up so that they wouldn’t have to take responsibility for any of the mess."

        "reply": "I’m in a workplace with about half field people and half office people. It’s probably 90% men and 10% women in the field (the managers of the field employees spend some time in the office though), and vice versa in the office. So in the office it’s primarily women and some of us guys are in and out. Any sort of work related to social events is almost always done by the women. Even though we’re sometimes in the office, we might be asked for input, but our response is generally of the “we’re good with whatever you choose” variety unless it’s blatant. While the women are seemingly enthusiastic about having input.\n\nI find this with other areas as well. Any sort of events at schools is primarily done by moms and women that work there. On the soccer teams, dads are coaches but the moms are keeping everything organized, scheduling snacks, and keeping track of time. I’ve been a part of many baby showers and housewarming events, women are directing everything and guys are basically just going along with whatever they decide. I think generally, women take matters into their own hands either because they want to or because they’re expected to. A lot of guys don’t do anything because we don’t want to and we’re not expected to. It doesn’t really matter if we don’t have ideas for the office party because 1. we’re not expected to have any and 2. we don’t really care about the outcome, we’ll be good with some pizzas or donuts left out on the gang box. The one time I had a gathering just for the boys because my friend is having his first kid, all he said was bring diapers and alcohol and we just hungout. I thought everything was cool but to my girl that was an unorganized, lackluster event. It’s a mix of several things going on here."

I kill all the bugs, hang the paintings, move the heavy stuff, and if something happens like equipment breaks or the electrical breaker goes out, I take care of it.

Quit without notice eventually. I hated that place for many reasons."

        "reply": "I'm an American but lived in Russia for a number of years. I did business consulting. I was working with a large retailer that had 1 female on their top managers level. She was the Human Resources director. Whenever there were management meetings she was the one that served the coffee. I asked her why she of all people served the coffee? It is after all part of her job to ensure all employees are treated equal. She couldn't answer me beyond it's expected... She accepted this.\n\nIn my own office I never allowed my secretary to get me coffee. The thought never entered my mind. My partner would stand at the coffee machine and ask her to get him coffee. Equal rights doesn't translate to equal perception of gender roles. The states is the most forward thinking in gender equality in the workplace. The rest of the world is behind or very, very far behind in its thinking. But even in the states the traditional gender roles have not gone away nor do I expect they will ever go away in marriage but they are getting better in the work place. \n\nI think an unfortunate part of the problem is the fear of woman that they will spend their careers wearing a \"bitch\" label around their neck and that label will interfere with their career advancement so they don't stick up for themselves enough when it comes to playing the traditional woman's role in an office. I've seen this with doctors making well into 6 figures, getting up to get the coffee for men in meetings. \n\nMen have not evolved their attitudes enough but it is slowly changing. But neither have woman. There is an acceptance of their roles in society. I also find there are regional differences. Being a New Yorker I find woman think differently about these things when I would travel to the south.  They are far more accepting of expectations of their roles in the workplace than us Yankees. \n\nMy only point being, yes, men are to blame but woman do have their share in that blame."

Surprise surprise, their wives made the cookies in 100% of the cases. This year, someone asked if the event was happening again because that lady quit and they wanted to know who was organizing it because they wanted to taste all the delicious cookies. Everyone asked *me*, because i’m the next youngest woman around. Not because of my job, but because i’m the token female so *naturally* i would organize the damn thing. I said absolutely fucking not. So that’s the story of why it didn’t happen. Because none of the men saw it as their job. Everybody just knows, deep down, that things like this (and christmas stockings and easter baskets etc) only magically appear because women take these things on. Because we want human life to be warm and meaningful. And when we don’t, things just don’t happen. Well fuck you all for taking us for granted."

If they didn't care, they wouldn't participate...but they often do.  \n\nWhen I was younger, I was treated like my department's social director.  If someone was having a baby or retiring or whatever, people--usually guys--would come up to me and say \"You know, we really should throw so-and-so a party.\"  And I would say something like, \"Yeah, we should.  If you want to organize it, I'll help.\"  And I'd hear squat from them. They didn't want to organize it...and I didn't blame them one bit because I didn't either.  Inevitably, my boss would appoint me or another woman to be the organizer and we would reluctantly do it.  We wouldn't complain about it.  We would even be cheerful about it.  But it wasn't something we were thrilled about doing.\n\nI think the reason you see women doing the organizing is after a while, we get used to serving in that capacity."

They just jumped in. Maybe they saw someone doing the work and asked *where* they could help, but they volunteered to help on their own. \n\nIf you want to be the change you want to see in the world, just jump in and start doing what needs doing.

I feel very at ease here now, and it’s a perfect compromise being able to get to the convenience of the city but without being “in” it.\n\nBefore living here, we lived in another still residential area but more crowded, closer to a train station and shops, and even that was very bad for my mental health.\n\nBut compare this to my husband, who grew up in the city, literally has no problem being around tons of people and noise.

Are you secure in who you are, are you working on personal goals, do you maintain friendships & do things just because you want to? Parents who give all of themselves to their kids are not modeling for them how to be good to themselves. They watch when you don’t think they’re watching, so just keep that in mind."

So I think the best a parent can do for their children is teaching values, things like respecting people, being polite, patient, defend themselves, stuff like that, but other than that, it's part of their lives to chose if they wanna play soccer or basketball for example or if they wanna be a constructor or a dentist"

After she started dating my dad he stopped."

        "reply": "My dad died last summer and I was organising a few of his things when I stumbled upon a “Do not open or I will beat you” box of his, from when he was a teen (or in his early 20s). I found a ton of letters between him and his ex girlfriend who was from a neighbouring country. Luckily I understand the language so I was able to read it. In one of the letters that are from 1997/98 not sure, she was complaining about having to go to work at a bar and I realised that the bar, she was at the time working at, was the same bar I went to a few months prior to his death because of a party. It’s not really a famous club or bar or anything like that and the party was really niche plus it wasn’t in our country… Truly a “we are all connected” type of coincidence. \nI immediately wanted to share what I found in the “do not open” box but then realised I can’t… I still occasionally remember this and always have this instinct to share it with him followed by a wave of sadness upon realisation. I even instinctively wanted to ask my grandma (his mom) but she died little less than a year before my dad did so this coincidence will forever be under appreciated… And thats the only prior relationship I know… I don’t know much about a woman who gave birth to me haven’t seen her since I was less than 10 years old after they split and she started ignoring us, she tried to contact me a few years back with something along the lines of “well a phone works both ways” but I told her to fuck off…"

He was always trying to smuggle drugs and other goods from Mexico back into Cali and was just a wild dude. After a while he started getting really possessive over my mom, she told me she would go to the grocery store and when she came back he’d be pissed and accusing her of cheating. She realized she needed to end it. While still dating this dude, another good looking guy started work at the nursery she worked at. He was infatuated w my mom and asked her out twice but turned him down bc she wasn’t single. Then my mom and her bf got in a huge fight, he became abusive and so she left for good. This guy literally got on his knees at my mom’s feet and *begged* my mom to come back, but she was just done.   About a month later the guy at work asked her out again and she said “why not”. They ended up having a blast and a whirlwind relationship, fell deeply in love and got married after only 6 weeks! They had me and my sister several years later and stayed together for over 30 years till my dad died 2 years ago."

He moved in with her at her parent's house and she caught him stealing her dad's money so she kicked him out. She stupidly got back together with him when he moved into a flat with a friend and he was working as a chef in a restaurant. His name was Jake and his friend's name was Blake (not really but point is they rhymed). My mum once went into the restaurant where a woman she knew in there was telling her that Jake was asking her daughter to go out with him. My mum obviously hasn't happy about it and asked him wtf he was playing at. Jake kept insisting it wasn't him who did it and it was actually Blake. She got home to a bunch of roses from him so she cut the heads off them and threw them in the bin. My mum's parents were about to go on holiday and her mum told her that she's got neighbours keeping an eye on the place so she better not bring him back again. She didn't. Apparently he was an all-round dodgy guy and even after they'd split up, people would come round to the house saying he owed them money, etc. I wonder where he is now."

Loneliness is everything it's cracked up to be.\n\nMy father used to go every morning to a diner for a corn muffin and cup of coffee on his way to work. He of course knew the counter waitresses and would leave a buck tip which was more than the muffin and coffee cost in those days. I think he enjoyed the couple of sentences exchanged more than the muffin. The words from the theme song of the serial \"Cheers\": \"you wanna go where everybody knows your name\" are actually very profound as you will understand when you get old.\n\nHabits help us avoid decision making.

Fitness freaks are gonna tell you all sorts of shit and then drop dead at 50 because they have fucked up genetics. Fastfood is never going to be as bad for you as your parents. If you want to live your maximum, stay away from smoking and booze. Maintain a vaguely healthy weight, ideally with a tiny bit plus, because you'll need the reserve it if you have an injury or sickness. Take it a little easy.

I recently used Cold Turkey blocker and got off the site for about 4 months which was nice for the time, but I always felt like I had FOMO so it ended up sucking me back in. I always feel like I'm worse off for browsing the site, but yet I'm still here. How is everyone else feeling about Reddit these days?",

Heroic space opera investigations.  They have to track down corruption and cultists in the Empire of Man.\n\nProject Hail Mary - by Andy Weir who wrote the Martian.  Basically the Martian but he arrives at another star system with no memory and has to figure out why he is there and how to get back.\n\nPriscilla Hutchins - semi-near future space exploration.  Survival stories in space and alien worlds.\n\nAlex Benedict - far future \"archaeology\" and mystery solving.  Look for lost colonies, missing star ships, etc."

We had other connections too - our brothers were friends and played soccer together and my sister went to the same school as her. \n\nIn our teens when we ran into each other, I always thought she was pretty. We just used to smile at each other and say hi, but nothing more. We ended up going to the same college and there we quickly became good friends. I am generally shy and introverted, but with her I always felt comfortable. In the next two years we became best friends. I realized I had feelings for her but didn't want to confess because I was afraid of ruining our friendship. Little did I know that she felt the same way about me (although I suspected that she felt the same way). \n\nOne cold thanksgiving night we were talking on the phone and I was telling her that I was missing her so much and ended up confessing my love for her. To my delight she said that she felt the same way and we started dating. We dated for 7 years (4 of which were long distance) and after that we got married. We have been married for 11 years now (together for 18 years) and have a sweet little 5 year old. I am more in love with her than I have ever been."

We’re a family of 2 so we mostly buy meat and vac seal and freeze it, and a handful of fresh and dry goods.  I definitely wouldn’t justify doing all my shopping there. \n\nSo depends on the size of your family and how much you like shopping, cause it’s one more place you gotta stop.  I don’t mind shopping, I get a hot dog, and the cash back on the executive membership covers the membership cost for me, so imo it’s worth it."

I was always traveling in a small area of the world to go to school, a few streets over from home to see friends (in a good neighborhood), and the rest of the time I was playing baseball with a decent group of people.... \n\nThe media and news always cover terrible stories, but if you think about it, they are covering news over the entire globe. So, a lot of these instances are very isolated in nature, and once you hear all of the circumstances surrounding said bad event, then you can even realize that the majority of these bad events could have been completely avoided (or anyone with 2 brain cells could see the outcome long before it ever escalated to making it on the news).\n\nSo, I just try to keep my wits about me, filter out people who I see being a problem, know the terrain (gang areas vs. good areas), and this last part is much harder than it sounds - be a positive person who leads by example and always encourages other people to keep their head up and do the right thing. That shit is contagious. You hear that negativity is contagious, and while that is absolutely true, so is positivity. If you are being positive and you notice that the people around you are still super Debby Downers, then just chalk that up to what it is and make an attempt to find more positive people to be around.\n\nNow, I know that a lot is out of my control, but you have to accept that. All you can do is bring the best version of yourself to the table as often as possible all while staying vigilant about problem places and people.\n\nIt gets easier. I promise. Also, I do not have social media (unless you count reddit), and I rarely watch the news. I don't need to see a bunch of crazy stuff all of the time in order to feel up to date. A little here and a little there just to get a feel for what is actually happening and boom, I turn it off."

Getting off of most social media was the best thing I ever did for my mental health, especially as a woman in my 20s. When you are online, it might sound silly, but follow some “good news” pages. Some people make content to combat exactly what you’re talking about - the constant chaos and tragedy of the world. It’s good to be informed, but it’s not bad to get yourself right first. \nAlso, it’s really not *all* doom and gloom out there. Doom and gloom has always and will always be around, but if you’re in a position where your personal reality is a good one, you don’t have to feel guilty for having that privilege. If none of us took the time to enjoy the little things, it would certainly be all bad. We sometimes make ourselves think that it’s wrong for having a good life when so many others are facing horrible realities. But we can’t all save the world. You’re not ignoring the state of things by unplugging, you’re just taking care of yourself. The news will always be there - you will not. So while you’re here, be here."

I answered that I am not, but was curious as to why he'd think that. He told me my narrow but tall nose gives my face character and that such a recognizable face would be perfect for an actor. I was very surprised by the comment. As a male, I'm not used to getting compliments at all, and I've always been teased about having a bird's beak.\n\nI thought it was interesting how the statement proves that my nose stands out, but frames it in a positive light. I might reconsider getting plastic surgery lol. \n\nI hope that you all have a good week 🙌\n\nEdit: Added estimated age of said stranger",

        "reply": "For me as a 30yo a lot of my favourite stories from my life ended up just being brief encounters and little observations. Looking back I think they're often more exciting than the wild parties or far out experiences I expected would define my adventurous young adulthood.  \n  \nBut if you're seeking more variety in your adult life and you feel your environment is limited, I strongly suggest changing it. For me it was moving to a big international city in my own country, but it could equally be moving out of a city or moving to a different country altogether.  \n  \nIn my opinion moving to a different environment is one of the best ways to experience an impactful, life changing adventure. It won't all be sunshine and roses, but it will be a damn good story - and yours to write!"

        "reply": "Welcome. \n\nYep. It can get pretty repetitive.\n\nThis problem really becomes terrifying when you are afraid to keep getting out there. I've had bad experiences going out, too; however, never did I allow that to stop me from getting out and/or caring about what some idiots out there think of me. I merely learned to read people, environments, and situations better. \n\nIt gets easier to keep getting out there as you get older. I believe I felt the way you're currently feeling from 22-26. Mainly due to the fact that I was busting my ass for those fours years to build up a good enough resume to allow me to then move and keep moving, if I wanted to. Then, I landed a really nice job in a new exciting area. It really spiced things up in my life. I had money and a new area to explore.\n\nBUT, yes. Life slows down a lot. In college you had alllll sorts of classes to take. All of them were at least slightly different. That's interesting right there. Then, some days you don't have much in the way of classes so you can do whatever you want with your free time. You also had a ton people around you experiencing the same thing, so you had a lot of people in the same boat as you.\n\n Once you start working, you're working a minimum of 40hrs/week, you have bills to pay, chores, and probably only 15 days of PTO per year (if you're lucky). That right there takes up a lot of time and energy. Your priorities change. Then some people start having kids and you may never see them again. You're no longer around a bunch of people your same age, in a small finite zone. \n\nSo, my advice would be to work really hard right now, build up all of your skills so that you can get into a great job that you actually enjoy or at least don't mind being at 240+ days out of the year, and getting out on the weekends to find people that you really enjoy being around. Then, you can put your heads together and go places in order to create those memories you so long to create. It's tough! It really is. But once you have skills and a bank account, then your life will feel more open. \n\nSo, relax! You'll get there. It's a big change."

        "reply": "Remember, adulthood isn't about losing excitement, but rather finding it in different ways. Maybe try doing the things you used to do even without the people you used to hang out with, find a new friends that shares the same insights in life like you.

        "reply": "I would do this on a societal level because of how it would work. At its core is where people with gentle and actually kind personalities are treated with extreme caution and fragility and are subsequently sacred. The girls within that group would be taught to take care of their bodies and be pampered. Those girls would then do it to the boys in that group. Then, as they age, more independence is utilized by the girls to mentor the boys so that the boys can be pampered like the girls. As they mature, the boys are to be more like girls in emotional understanding and are treated like the girls are treated. There will not be any sort of gendered separation between the sacred people. The people in this group can coexist perfectiously. \n\nAs for the people who are not sacred, they perform all of the necessary labor. They will remain unchanged, but only the girls are allowed to go between the normal and sacred groups. \n\nIf a girl were to experience something that changes them, they can become sacred, especially if they are emotionally changed and become softer and more sacred. They will be able to be sacred and get the privileges and luxuries that sacredness affords. \n\nI understand this may not be a superpower, but this would be the superpower I would have that would be applied to people who end up being like me in personality from birth. \n\nHow does this process work, you may ask? This works by astrology and other personality tests. Each person has their entire natal chart written out on paper. From there, this is analyzed for the traits of the sacred (fragile emotions, kindness, etc). People with these traits are transported to the sacred living quarters. \n\nThe superpower I would have is the ability to be a girl emotionally and be able to be cared for like a girl. That would mean absolutely no boys and an environmentally redone life. I would be put into a state of unconsciousness and would awaken with the personality of a girl and a new phone, specifically set up for the feminine life. That entire society thing was created as an example of how this superpower would be if it was applied to a society. I would awaken into a room of soft textures and specific colors that would be perfect for me. Girls would be around in the building where this room is. I would be put through the process of finding out how my emotions are feminine. I would become more like a girl emotionally. The only physical effect is the change of skin to smooth pampered skin."

        "source": "So today I had to jump over my fence to unlock it\nThis is my first ever post on this subreddit.  \n\n\nSo today was garbage collection day in my neighborhood and my usual routine is walk out to my backyard, unlock the gate to my backyard, walk out to my front yard and collect the trash can, roll back the trash can back to the gate of my backyard, open the gate to my backyard, roll the trash can through the gate into my backyard, close the gate, but today life had other plans for me. To preface this, the lock on the gate to my backyard is an old fashioned hook where you close the gate and push the hook through it.  \n\n\nI observed the garbage truck collecting my trash at around 01:15 PM today and decided to just collect the trash can now so I don't have to do it later at night. There was heavy gusts of wind and a violent rainpour but I just decided to push through it. I opened the door to my backyard and sprinted through my backyard like an olympian while enjoying the feeling of the wind blowing against my hair and the free shower from the water droplets. I unlocked my backyard gate and sprinted across my front yard to get the trash can and begin rolling the trash can across my front yard to finally get this mundane task over with. I approached the gate to my backyard ready to open it and finish this chore once and for all.  \n\n\nThat's when life threw a wrench in my plans. I pushed against the gate to my backyard. It didn't bulge. I pushed again. It didn't bulge. That's when I realized that as I was rolling the trash can across my front yard to the gate of my backyard, the violent gusts of wind of the ongoing storm had blown the gate to my backyard shut and the hook lock to cover it as well. The front door was locked. I had no other way into my house other than the door to my backyard, but that was closed off due the gate being locked. Mind you, I didn't even have my phone, so I couldn't call for help if anything else went awry. That's when a lightbulb shined brightly over my head.  \n\n\nI pushed the trash can in front of the gate to my backyard. I climbed on top of my trash can, it took me 2 tries. Once on top, I looked down and just braced myself for the inevitable, the call of the void. I jumped over the fence and dropped down. It was a 5 foot drop. My legs didn't break fortunately. I unlocked the gate to my backyard and rolled in my trash can. The mundane task was done. I hope none of my neighbors saw me jumping over my own fence and call the cops on me. It looks truly suspicious from an outsider's perspective. Maybe next time I'll put a brick or something in the doorway so it doesn't shut out on me completely. This entire ordeal lasted 8 minutes, and it was the longest 8 minutes of my life.   \n\n\nAt least I got my cardio in today. I can't wait to do this chore again in a week and see what happens. I'm coming to an action movie near you. Until then, have a nice day! This is JNORJT, signing off.",

He tried to use the back of my armchair as a scratching post and I just consistently picked him up and put him at his scratching post, then showered him with praise for using that. \n\nThe back of my chair has not a single scratchmark on it, and he leaves all of my other furniture alone too. He now has a scratching post, multiple scratching boards, and a cat tree. They all seem to be preferred over my furniture. :) \n\nI also taught my cat to give paws for a snack. Now he will come up to me every now and again and do a paw motion to indicate he wants a lil snack. He's a good boy."

My parents would always talk about the ghost in the house causing problems.\n\nA combination of A) us moving to a different house when I was about 13, and B) growing older and getting better at just learning to live with my dad's mean side, meant the pranks had stopped. \n\nI used to wonder if my parents had secretly known it was me (and just could never prove it) but played along with the whole ghost in the house thing, but no.

He had to lie on the couch in our cottage with a heating pad on his back, but I still had the best time! I collected driftwood and rocks on the beach, I took the dogs rambling down grassy beach trails, I bought weird food from village markets (my favorite are the old fashioned corner stores with cast iron pans, a basket of apples and bananas, and some cinnamon bread the owner baked before opening the store all for sale in the same crowded little 100 year old space), I bought scented candles, homemade bread, Amish jam, ice cream and Mexican food for both of us. Maybe you could just pack up a great book, a box of really good quality chocolate and a bottle of champagne and go enjoy yourself on a beach. Life always intervenes; it could rain, it could be too cloudy for a good sunset, but who cares! Book yourself into a spa or a great hotel if the weathers lousy or it’s too crowded and watch movies and order room service. The point is, you deserve to be celebrated!
