My days are often spent with my supportive partner, who shares my love for the nostalgic and the valuable, making our home a haven for collectibles. Watching the news is a habit I've picked up, as it aligns with my belief in the order and structure of capitalism, shaping my understanding of the world around me. While my age might be tender, my fascination with history and tradition hints at a deeper appreciation for the enduring and the timeless. MBTI: ISTJ.",
